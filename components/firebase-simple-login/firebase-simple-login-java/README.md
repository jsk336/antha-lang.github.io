# Firebase Simple Login - Android Client

Firebase Simple Login is a simple, easy-to-use authentication service built on
top of [Firebase Custom Login](https://www.firebase.com/docs/security/custom-login.html),
allowing you to authenticate users without any server code.

Enable authentication via a number of third-party providers, anonymous login, or email / password authentication without having to manually store authentication credentials or run a server.

## Installation

To install in your application, [download from the Firebase CDN](https://www.firebase.com/docs/downloads.html),
or install as a Maven dependency:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.firebase</groupId>
  <artifactId>firebase-simple-login</artifactId>
  <version>[1.3.0,)</version>
</dependency>
```

See [https://www.firebase.com/docs/security/simple-login-java-overview.html](https://www.firebase.com/docs/security/simple-login-java-overview.html)
for complete documentation and API reference.

## Configuration

The Firebase Simple Login Java Client supports email & password, Facebook, Google,
Twitter, and anonymous authentication methods. Before adding to
your application, you'll need to first enable these auth. providers in your app.

To get started, visit the Simple Login tab in Firebase Forge, at
`https://<YOUR-FIREBASE>.firebaseio.com`. There you may enable / disable auth.
providers, setup OAuth credentials, and configure valid OAuth request origins.

## Usage

Start monitoring user authentication state in your application by instantiating
the Firebase Simple Login client with a Firebase reference, and callback.

```java
Firebase ref = new Firebase("https://SampleChat.firebaseIO.com");
SimpleLogin authClient = new SimpleLogin(ref, getApplicationContext());
```

Note that instantiating the Simple Login constructor with a valid Android context
is required in order for the client to seamlessly persist and load sessions across
application restarts.

Once you have instantiated the client library, check the user's authentication
status:

```java
authClient.checkAuthStatus(new SimpleLoginAuthenticatedHandler() {
  public void authenticated(Error error, User user) {
    if (error != null) {
      // Oh no! There was an error performing the check
    } else if (user == null) {
      // No user is logged in
    } else {
      // There is a logged in user
    }
  }
});
```

In addition, you can monitor the user's authentication state with respect to your Firebase by observing events at a special location: .info/authenticated

```java
Firebase authRef = ref.getRoot().child(".info/authenticated");
authRef.addValueEventListener(new ValueEventListener() {
  public void onDataChange(DataSnapshot snap) {
    boolean isAuthenticated = snap.getValue(Boolean.class);
  }
  public void onCancelled() {}
});
```

If the user is logged out, try authenticating using the provider of your choice:

```java
authClient.loginWithEmail("email@example.com", "very secret", new SimpleLoginAuthenticatedHandler() {
  public void authenticated(Error error, User user) {
    if(error != null) {
      // There was an error logging into this account
    }
    else {
      // We are now logged in!
    }
  }
});
```
