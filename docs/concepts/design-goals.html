<p>The guiding philosophy of Antha is to bring the benefits of modern programming <br />
practice to the practice of biological experimentation. There are many innovations<br />
which are widely used in the software community that are not available to biological<br />
experimenters but which would bring enormous gains in productivity. </p>

<p>The Antha language has therefore been designed with the following princples in mind: </p>

<h2 id="emphasise-readability">Emphasise Readability</h2>

<p>A core purpose of the Antha system is to establish a <em>de facto</em> standard language for <br />
defining protocols and parts for use in biological experimentation. Therefore it is <br />
designed to mask some of the programming detail from the user and focus on the <br />
biology.  </p>

<p>It is also important to consider the needs of the wider community: for a language to <br />
serve as a vehicle for precise scientific communication it is preferable to avoid<br />
giving people the chance to write in widely divergent styles. The section-based format<br />
is aimed to make the important principles of the protocol such as its inputs, outputs<br />
and purpose, able to be read at a glance, and the language is deliberately restrictive<br />
in its syntax. The focus on function and purpose as opposed to implementation is another<br />
feature which helps to make protocols more readable. </p>

<p>Additionally the use of a structured, text-based format with a domain specific vocabulary<br />
permits the use of version control systems to track how protocols evolve and change over<br />
time and identify which changes are responsible for particular behaviour and avoid repeating<br />
mistakes. </p>

<h2 id="concurrency-is-central">Concurrency Is Central</h2>

<p>Biology is complicated. The number of experiments required to characterise and define <br />
even simple systems robustly can easily amount to hundreds. The way Antha defines protocols<br />
is intended to make scheduling huge numbers of experiments to run in parallel essentially<br />
the same process as defining a single run. </p>

<p>An Antha protocol is intended to define the series of operations to be performed on a<br />
single experimental sample. These samples can be replicated or run with varying parameter<br />
values to define a larger-scale experiment. The scheduling part of the execution environment<br />
can then determine which currently running protocols have similar requirements and improve<br />
efficiency by running them together. This allows automated systems to be used with maximum <br />
efficiency.</p>

<h2 id="define-what-not-how">Define <strong>What</strong> Not <strong>How</strong></h2>

<p>Typical biological protocols are full of implementation details and it takes a great deal of<br />
expertise on the part of the user to know which steps are critical and which could be done<br />
differently. Very often the purpose of each step is difficult to determine and it takes a lot<br />
of experience to get some techniques right. This leads to situations where labs lose techniques<br />
when particular members leave and it is difficult to identify why particular results cannot be<br />
reproduced. </p>

<p>Antha aims to rectify this in two ways: execution details are generally omitted from protocols<br />
and in many cases certain precise information will only be available when the protocol is run. <br />
Criticial constraints can be expressed as constraints to the system, however the Antha style<br />
is to leave implementation details for the scheduler to decide. This means the purpose of the<br />
steps stands out much more from the implementation details. </p>

<p>Secondly by recording protocols in a standard, executable form and tracking everything (see below)<br />
once protocols are created they can be used again and again without needing to know anything but<br />
how Antha will interpret the protocol. </p>

<h2 id="facilitate-quality">Facilitate Quality</h2>

<p>Software design has benefitted hugely from the advent of test-driven and behaviour-driven design<br />
approaches. Best practice in software design emphasises development of code as comprising multiple <br />
unit operations and defining their behaviour with tests which encompass how they should perform<br />
given certain inputs. </p>

<p>Although it is not directly enforced, the design of Antha is intended to make workflows act as<br />
a set of simultaneously running services, each providing a particular part of a protocol, essentially<br />
defining unit operations. </p>

<p>For testing, Antha defines a Validation section whose aim is to provide a series of tests which any<br />
protocol must pass to be defined as having succeeded. That way users can know if a particular step<br />
is a problem and protocols which repeatedly fail validation tests can be marked as unsafe. </p>

<h2 id="record-everything">Record Everything</h2>

<p>It’s easy to forget small steps in protocols and painful to have to write everything down afterwards. <br />
Antha is designed to track all operations and specific inputs on samples automatically, saving <br />
time and sanity while facilitating quality.</p>

<h2 id="catch-mistakes-early">Catch Mistakes Early</h2>

<p>Antha makes use of the idea of strong variable typing to help ensure that protocols make sense, <br />
particularly when linked together. That means you can’t tell a liquid handler to pipette 4g of<br />
a solid or set a thermostat to 20ul. The unit system helps to prevent numerical errors by handling<br />
relevant conversions for you. Simulation is also used extensively for runtime checking and predicting<br />
execution times.</p>
